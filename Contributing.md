## Steps

The first step in contributing to the code base is [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

If you have an existing fork, make the repo is up-to-date. Always create the
branch off the actively developed branch (typically `develop` or `master`)

For bug fixes:

- Create a branch
- Once the bug has been fixed (with the proper tests described below) submit a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
- If there is an existing open issue, reference the issue number in the pull
request description.

For new features:

If this feature has not yet been discussed with the core contributors, head
over to the mailing list and make the suggestion. This ensures we are aware
of your intention and ultimately your time is not wasted if your feature is
better suited as a standalone library.

If the feature has been discussed and a ticket has been opened, then proceed
with similar steps as above:

- Create a branch
- Once implemented with tests and documentation, submit a pull request
referencing the open ticket.


For documentation:

- Create a branch
- Submit a pull request
