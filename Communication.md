## Feedback

First off, thank you for taking the time to provide feedback! Here are few
guidelines for providing feedback:

- For questions, take the time to thoroughly articulate and provide enough
context so everyone reading understands the question. If you are having a hard
time knowing _how_ to ask a question, just do your best!

- For feature requests or general ideas, please take a trip through the
issue tracker and the mailing list to see if there are any related requests
or planned features. If you find one, add a comment otherwise please describe
your request on the mailing list.
