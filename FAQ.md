### How did this project originate?

Daniel Lindsley gave a talk at PyCon 2013 about "How (Not) To Build An OSS
Community" which hit on many different points as to why most OSS communities
fail to grow or even begin. The overarching pattern with each point he made
was **communication**.

This wiki template acts as a starting point for doing just that. It also acts
as a checklist for the other various components that _should_ be in existence
to successfully grow a community around your project.

### Why are some of the pages partially filled out?

Because I haven't checked everything off the list for this project yet =)
